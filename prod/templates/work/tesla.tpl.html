            <p>For Tesla Motors in Austin, South By Southwest is the perfect opportunity to market themselves in an innovative way to the many technology-related visitors and residents of the area. In an effort to spread the word and grow their marketing, we created a way to interact with people in an individual way &mdash; by allowing them to customize their own Tesla and share it with the world. Planned to be used on iPads on site as well as on the in-dash web browser of a Tesla Model S, the site would let visitors pick their Tesla's color, roof, wheels, and interior before sharing a photo of it on their own Twitter account with the hashtag &ldquo;#TeslaSXSW.&rdquo; Tesla Austin would then randomly pick certain users who had posted their customizations to win a day of being driven around South By Southwest in a chauffeured Model S. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the full design and execution of the promotion was unable to be executed. The responsive site was built using Gulp, SASS, and Compass, with Express and Node.js handling the back-end integration with the Twitter API for social sharing.</p>
