            <p>Growing up, the mutant outcast heroes of Marvel Comics known as the X-Men struck a personal chord with me, leading to immense collections of action figures, comic books, and a probably unhealthy Saturday morning cartoon addiction just to catch up with the latest adventures of Wolverine and friends. When Marvel announced an API with references to their entire history of publishing, it was time to turn that childhood obsession into something amazing. Initially conceived as a quick experiment to combine the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Marvel API</a>, the Google Maps API, and the Meteor JavaScript platform, World Of X quickly became an expansive and comprehensive guide to almost every location in which the X-Men have lived and battled. Based on a fully interactive map, the site allows visitors to explore these locations with large comic book imagery, a full description of the location and its relevance to the X-Men, and a link to every comic series in which the location has played a part. World Of X is fully responsive across all sizes and devices (even including a full-screen big picture mode) and was built using SASS on the Meteor platform with Marvel and Google Maps API integration.</p>
